<div class="paragraph">Do you feel like that, too? <br> I know you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here. <br> Insecurities can be about a lot of things.<br>From your habits, to your appearance, to certain skills...I know exactly how that feels. <br> You either feel like a total imposter, or the worst person on Earth.<br>
So I'm here to remind you that that's simply not true.<br> You are healthy, intelligent, kind and gorgeous.<br>You are not faking any of it.<br> And if there's some skill you feel like you're bad at, remember, practice makes perfect. <br>If perfection exists, that is. <br> You see, no-one is really perfect.<br>It's all relative.<br>
You're not <i>supposed</i> to be perfect, nobody is.<br> Sometimes there are a lot of expectations, and pressure too, but never let that weigh you down.<br>
You are worth way more than your looks or even your grades.<br>And if it is to come down to that, I'll just add that I think you're gorgeous.<br>And super smart. You make such cool websites, and it seems so effortless.<br>
And here I am working on this for weeks yet it still looks mid asf.<br> Your hair is so cute and floofy.<br>Your smile the most heartmelting everrrr.<br>You're the perfect size and shape for a hug, I love your hugs.<br>
And you're a great person, you care about important things.<br>So...in the face of all that I don't think there's any situation under which it's fair for you to feel insecure.<br>
If my word isn't enough, ask your parents.<br> Or a friend, they'll agree.<br>You're awesome, have some more faith in yourself <3.<br><br><br>Sincerely,<br>Zainab.
