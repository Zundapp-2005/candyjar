    <div class="paragraph">Hello Ayaya!<br><br> First and foremost, I want you to know that it’s okay to feel the way you do right now. <br>Anxiety can be overwhelming and isolating, but please remember that you are not alone in this.<br> Many people around the world experience similar feelings, and there's no shame in seeking comfort and support.<br>

Take a moment to breathe deeply.<br> Inhale slowly, filling your lungs with air, and then exhale gently, letting go of some of that tension. It's a simple step, but it can help to center your mind.

<br>Sometimes, when we feel anxious, our thoughts start to race, and it can be challenging to see a way out.<br> In these moments, try to focus on the present.<br> Look around and find something that brings you peace—whether it's the sound of birds chirping outside, the scent of a favorite candle, or the feel of a soft blanket.<br> Grounding yourself in the present can help calm the whirlwind of thoughts.<br>

Talking to someone can make a world of difference.<br> Reach out to a friend, family member (or me, of course).<br> Sharing what you're going through can lift some of the weight off your shoulders and remind you that there are people who care about you and want to help.

<br>Remember to be kind to yourself.<br> You deserve compassion and understanding, especially from yourself.<br> It’s easy to be hard on ourselves when we’re struggling, but acknowledging your feelings and giving yourself permission to feel them is an important step toward healing.

<br>Lastly, take things one step at a time. <br>You don't have to solve everything all at once.<br> Small steps can lead to big changes, and each step forward, no matter how small, is a victory.<br>

Please know that you are stronger than you think, and brighter days are ahead.<br> You got this! And remember: <br>I'm always here for you.
<br><br>
Love, Zainab.
