    <div class="paragraph">"An empty mind is the devil's playground," they say. <br>
But what does that actually mean?<br> The devil isn't actually entering minds, so this basically refers to the overthinking that arises when you're alone.<br>
Not that being alone is a bad thing, but for extended periods of time it can be unhealthy.<br>You don't always have to be alone to feel lonely...<br>Sometimes
you'll feel lonely even in a room full of people.<br>You may feel alienated, misunderstood, unsupported, and a burden.<br>You might feel nobody really cares about you,<br>
or at least not enough to really "get" you.<br>You might have emotions that are too complicated to convey to someone else...<br>Even if they really try, some emotions
are ours to shoulder alone because nobody can ever <i>truly</i> stand in someone else's shoes.<br>All of these feelings give rise to what we call loneliness.<br>
When you feel lonely, it helps to think about times when you felt surrounded by people.<br>Supportive people, who cared about you.<br>Think of times you actually felt
understood and loved.<br>There are sure to be a lot of such moments.<br>And of course, talk to someone.<br>"Isn't that counterintuitive?" you ask,<br>because I just mentioned
some emotions nobody else can understand?<br>No, because a lot of times they don't need to understand.<br>A good friend can make you feel better even when they don't fully understand your problem.<br>
So make some plans!<br>You don't have to go around telling them you feel lonely.<br>Just make a spontaneous plan for a fun activity.<br>Do it with your family,<br>
your friends, or me.<br>I'm always gonna drop everything and help you out :)<br>And while this may not sound very helpful to you, just trust me on it.<br>
I have learned that sometimes after hanging out with loved ones, one returns home with a glowing ball of light in one's chest.<br><br><br>Yours,<br> Zainab</div>
